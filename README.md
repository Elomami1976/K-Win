## 📥 Download

[![Download K-win](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-K--win%20v1.0.0-blue)](https://github.com/Elomami1976/K-Win/releases/latest/download/K-win.exe)

**[⬇️ Download Latest Release](https://github.com/Elomami1976/K-Win/releases/latest)**

> **⚠️ Windows SmartScreen notice:** When you first run `K-win.exe`, Windows 11 may show a blue **"Windows protected your PC"** screen. This happens because the app is not yet code-signed — it is not a virus detection. Click **More info** → **Run anyway** to start K-win. If the button doesn't appear, right-click the .exe → **Properties** → check **Unblock** → **OK**, then run it again. K-win is fully open source, so you can review or build the code yourself.

## 🛡️ Safety First

K-win is designed with safety as a core requirement:

- ✅ Automatic Restore Points before major operations
- ✅ Backup-first changes for registry operations
- ✅ Undo support for recent operations
- ✅ Preview dialog before applying changes
- ✅ No risky “registry cleaner” behavior
- ✅ Open-source transparency
- ✅ No telemetry from the app itself (works offline)

For full technical details, see `SAFETY.md`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download `K-win.exe` from the latest release
2. Right-click and choose **Run as administrator**
3. Review changes in preview dialogs
4. Apply desired optimizations
5. Restart Windows if prompted

## ✅ Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 11 (22H2, 23H2, 24H2)
- **Architecture:** x64
- **Privileges:** Administrator rights required
- **Runtime:** Self-contained build (no separate .NET install required)

## 🏗️ Build from Source

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 (17.8+) with ".NET desktop development" workload
- .NET 8 SDK

### Build

dotnet build -c Release
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**“Windows protected your PC” (SmartScreen)**
→ Click **More info** → **Run anyway** (the app is unsigned but open source)
→ If there's no **Run anyway** button: right-click `K-win.exe` → **Properties** → check **Unblock** → **OK**

**“Changes are not applying”**
→ Run K-win as **Administrator**

**“How do I undo changes?”**
→ Use the **Undo** button in the app, or restore from a System Restore Point
